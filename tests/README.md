This is the testing code, and uses a seperate license from the library
itself, since most of it is copied from the testing framework of Edwin
Brady's Idris2.

The license there is under "Idris2_LICENSE".

---

To run, first install the main library (from the main directory) using:

idris2 --install elab-deriving

Then from this directory, run make
